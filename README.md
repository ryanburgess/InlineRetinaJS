InlineRetinaJS
==============

A simple way to use inline retina images without all the extra HTML markup.


Requirements
==============

JQuery


How to use
==============

Add InlineRetina.js after referencing JQuery.

Add a class "hd" to all inline images that also have a retina version available. The retina image needs to be saved with the same name and same directory as the non-retina version but also appending "@2x" to the end of the name.

Example:

Original inline image: images/hero-skitch.png

Retina version: images/hero-skitch@2x.png
